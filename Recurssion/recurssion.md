Easy Level: Build the Basics
These problems help you get comfortable with the core ideas of recursion—base cases and recursive calls.

# Factorial Calculation
Write a function to compute the factorial of a number (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1).
Why it’s good: It’s a simple single recursive call with a clear base case (n = 0 or 1).
# Fibonacci Sequence
Create a function to find the nth Fibonacci number (e.g., Fib(5) = 5, where each number is the sum of the two before it).
Why it’s good: It introduces recursion with two calls, helping you see how multiple branches work.
# Power Function
Write a recursive function to calculate x raised to the power of n (e.g., 2^3 = 8).
Why it’s good: It’s a straightforward problem to practice breaking down a problem into smaller parts.
# Sum of Array Elements
Use recursion to find the sum of all elements in an array.
Why it’s good: It applies recursion to data structures, a common interview theme.
# Tree Traversal (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)
Practice traversing a binary tree recursively.
Why it’s good: Trees are naturally recursive, and this builds intuition for recursive structures.
Tip: For each problem, focus on identifying the base case (when to stop) and the recursive case (how to break it down). For example, in factorial, the base case is n = 1, and the recursive case is n * factorial(n-1).

Medium Level: Tackle More Complexity
These problems involve deeper recursion, multiple branches, or state management—perfect for preparing for backtracking and DP.

# Permutations
Generate all possible permutations of an array or string (e.g., [1, 2, 3] → [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], etc.).
Why it’s good: It introduces backtracking basics by exploring all possibilities.
# Combinations
Find all combinations of an array that sum to a target (e.g., [2, 3, 5] and target 8 → [3, 5]).
Why it’s good: It builds on recursion with decision-making (include or exclude an element).
Subsets
Generate all possible subsets of an array (e.g., [1, 2] → [], [2], [1], [1, 2]).
Why it’s good: It’s a classic recursive problem with branching choices.
N-Queens Problem
Place N queens on an NxN chessboard so no two attack each other.
Why it’s good: It’s a great intro to backtracking with constraints.
# Binary Tree Path Sum
Find all paths in a binary tree that sum to a given value.
Why it’s good: It combines tree recursion with path tracking, a common interview pattern.
Tip: Pay attention to how recursion branches (e.g., choosing an element or skipping it) and how to manage state. In backtracking, you’ll often need to “undo” choices after exploring a path.

Hard Level: Master Optimization and Integration
These problems require advanced recursion techniques, like combining it with DP (memoization) or solving complex backtracking scenarios.

Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in an array (e.g., [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7] → 4 from [2, 5, 3, 7]).
Why it’s good: It introduces recursion with memoization, a key DP concept.
Word Break
Check if a string can be segmented into words from a dictionary (e.g., "leetcode" with ["leet", "code"] → true).
Why it’s good: It’s a DP problem where recursion helps break the string into subproblems.
Regular Expression Matching
Match a string against a pattern with wildcards (e.g., "aa" and "a*" → true).
Why it’s good: It combines recursion with memoization for efficiency.
Sudoku Solver
Solve a partially filled Sudoku puzzle using backtracking.
Why it’s good: It’s a challenging backtracking problem with multiple constraints.
Palindrome Partitioning
Find all ways to partition a string into palindromic substrings (e.g., "aab" → ["aa", "b"], ["a", "a", "b"]).
Why it’s good: It blends recursion, backtracking, and string manipulation.
